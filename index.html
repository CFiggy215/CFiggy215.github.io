<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h4>My name is Brock Bingeman, aka blackbeltbrock!</h4>
<p>
Welcome to my website! Here you'll find my workout routines, my karate training, self defense videos,workouts, diet tips and MUCH MORE!!!
</p>
<p>
I created this site to show everything that i have done to get to where i'm currently at. I believe that with enough effort and dedication anyone can attain any goal they set in their mind too. 6 years ago i made the contiguous choice to turn my life around. At that time i was out of shape and unhappy with how my life was going. I lacked confidence in myself and i struggled with social activities. So i began working out with the P90X home workout program, fast forward 6 years, i have so much more confidence in myself, i love going out into this world to meet new people and experience new things! I owe a lot of my success and confidence to making the switch to a healthy/active lifestyle!
Paying it forward! -
</p>
<p>
I remember how tough it was to make this change in my life. I didn't have many people to talk to about it, I didn't know where to go to have my questioned answered and overall, i just felt like i was going through the process all alone. I know how that feels and i want to make sure no one else feels this way when they're making a positive change in their life. So now, i'm paying it forward! I'm not a personal trainer or dietitian, I'm just a guy who found what works best for me through trial and error. If i can help ANYONE with questions on training, dieting or just be a person people come to for motivation, I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON!!! I encourage anyone to send me an email with the email button at the top right of the screen, I will help as best as i possibly can. I charge NOTHING for any of my advice, i don't believe in making money off someone who is looking to get started!
Enjoy the Site! -
</p>
<p>
So thanks again for visiting! Please check out the tabs above, I hope you enjoy this site and i wish you all the best of luck for anything you are working towards!!! </p>

<h1>1stphorm</h1>
<p>I found this company back in October 2014 and I've been using their products ever since! While 1stphorm's products are some of the best I've ever used, more than that, this company stands for something. Their message is about doing your absolute best and that doesn't mean you have to be a bodybuilder or a fitness model to use this product line. They want to change the current fitness industry into what it should be about, DOING THE BEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE! I'm not a fitness model or a sponsored bodybuilder, I'm just a regular guy with a 9-5 job, I enjoy working out, living a healthy lifestyle and also trying to motivate others to make a positive change in their life! That is what this company stands for, being the best YOU that you can be and inspire others to do the same!!!</p>
<h1>The Difference</h1>

function p90(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="P90X/P90X2"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "My journey began with popping in the first disk to a fitness program that changed my life; P90X. I had a hard time going to a gym in the past because of the intimidating environment most gyms had. I was laughed at, questioned why I was there and that I was wasting my time. Needless to say, I didn't want to work out at that gym anymore! So I started P90X at home. Fast forward about 9 months, I completed 3 rounds of P90X and I got hooked on working out at home and enjoyed doing the program! I've continued to do home workouts for 6 year now with a few sessions at local gyms, but about 90% of my workouts at home. I currently follow the P90X2 program, which builds off of the original P90X just with more athletic training!";}
function wV(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Weighted Vest"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "AGAIN, PLEASE KNOW I'M NOT A TRAINER AND DO NOT RECOMMENDING THIS STYLE OF TRAINING FOR JUST ANYONE IN THIS SECTION!!! I say this, because after doing P90X for about 2 years, i decided i wanted to increase the intensity with weighted vest and wrist weights. The added weight from these items will add extra stress to the body and if you don't train with proper form you may end up hurting yourself. I worked my way up from an 8lb weight vest and gradually over time increased the weight as my body became accustomed to the weight. I currently train with 40lbs on my weighted vest and also wear two 2.5lb wrist weights. I want to say i don't believe this is a necessary training method to achieve your goals. I personally enjoy this style because I've done it for so long and enjoy the challenge!";}
function phil(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Philosophy"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "The whole point to any workout program should come down to this, why are you doing it? If you're training JUST to lose weight and to look good, while it's great to be in shape and we all want to look our best, this should be a very small reason to train. Instead, workout because you are becoming healthier. Don't workout to impress others, instead impress yourself. Push yourself to do the things you thought you'd never be able to do, try to see what you are truly capable of! Let's face it, working out isn't easy, it's tough and some days will be harder than others. If you are gonna do something this difficult for others instead of yourself, it'll become far more challenging. The best part is if you focus on making yourself better, for yourself, the other stuff (The Looks) will come naturally!";}
function que(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Questions?"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "As i stated before, i'm not a personal trainer. I'm just a guy who figured it out through trial and error. I made mistakes and i learned from them. I'd love to help others skip the mistakes i made in my training and help anyone reach their goals! Along with a good exercise program, your diet is key to getting the best results possible. So check out the Diet Tab for more info on how proper diet will lead to awesome results!!! I will post in the Calendar tab what workouts i'll be doing so you may follow long. If you'd like more information on anything training related or just have specific questions please click the email tab at the top right and i'll answer you as soon as i can!";}
