<h4>I'm Brock Bingeman, aka blackbeltbrock!</h4>
<p>
Here you&#39;ll find my monthly calendar, my karate training, workouts, diet tips and <b>MUCH MORE</b>!!!
</p>
<p>
I created this site to show everything that I have done to get to where I&#39;m currently at. I believe that with enough effort and dedication anyone can attain any goal they set their mind too. 6 years ago I made the contiguous choice to turn my life around. At that time I was out of shape and unhappy with how my life was going. I lacked confidence in myself and I struggled with social activities. So I Started my journey to become fit with <i>P90X</i>, the home workout program, 6 years of hard work and dedication and I now have so much more confidence in myself, I love going out into this world to meet new people and experience new things! I owe a lot of my success to the people who supported me from day one. So I made this website so that I can be that support and guidance in your life 
</p>
<p id="linkpg">
I remember how tough it was to make this change in my life. I didn&#39;t have many people to talk to about it, I didn&#39;t know where to go to have my questions answered and overall, I just felt like I was going through the process all alone. I know how that feels and I want to make sure no one else feels this way when they&#39;re making a positive change in their life. So now, I&#39;m paying it forward! I&#39;m not a personal trainer or dietitian; I&#39;m just a guy who found what works best for me through trial and error. If I can help ANYONE with questions on training, dieting or just be a person people come to for motivation, I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON!!! I encourage anyone to send me an by clicking the email icon at the top right of the screen, I will help as best as I possibly can. I charge NOTHING for any of my advice, I don&#39;t believe in making money off someone who is looking to get started! also check out my Calender for updates on my work out routine, just click the button below.

<p>
So thanks again for visiting! Please check out the rest of my page, I hope you enjoy this site and I can&#39;t wait to be a part of your fitness journey!!!</p>

<p id="txtwrp">To begin, I want to say I AM NOT A TRAINER!!! This is not meant to be a program I'm recommending for anyone to just try. I've spent the past 6 years training this way and it has taken me a long time to find what works best for me and is also enjoyable to do 6-7 days a week! The purpose of this section is simply to show transparency in my workouts and show that there is no SHORT CUTS to getting results, you have to WORK for them! So here we go!</p>

<h2>My Diet</h2>
<p>
Below I will explain my typical daily diet. Day to day life may alter this but 90% of the time this is what I eat. Though I like pizza and enjoy the occasional adult beverage I don’t restrict myself from the simple pleasures of life. If your goal is to be on stage and compete in any kind of body building show you need to have another level of discipline with the foods you are eating to reach your goals. I don't plan to be stepping on stage anytime soon. I eat this way so I can feel good throughout the day, have effective workouts and to practice karate at a high level! I'm not saying this is the best diet on earth, these are just the foods I enjoy eating on a regular basis that allow me to perform at my best!
    </p>
<h2>   
DON’T DO EVERYTHING AT ONE TIME!
</h2> 
<p>
If you try to change your entire diet right out of the gate, you'll find out very quickly just how tough it is to do so. So start slow, make 1 good change a week. The biggest and best change you can make is to eat a good balance breakfast every morning. I know what you're thinking, "I don't have time" is the biggest one, the second one is "I'm not hungry in the morning" Understand, the reason you don't feel hungry in the morning, is your body is in a "fasted" state. We sleep for about 7-8 hours a night with no food, so our body has begun to break down our muscle tissue for energy. You NEED to get out of the fasted state in the morning as soon as possible. So one thing I highly recommend to do is take a Protein Shake first thing in morning! LEVEL-1 from 1stphorm is what I call, "The Breakfast Excuse Destroyer" it's one of the big tasting shakes I've ever had and it will give your body what it needs to start your day off right! Shake it; Drink it; Ready to Go!!!
<br>
We tend to eat less throughout the day and try to make up for it at dinner time. Sustaining with Lunch and Dinner is typical for most adults since they try to make up for lack of nutrition by over eating at dinner, but by adding Breakfast back into the mix for 1 full week you’ll notice more energy throughout the day. Reintroducing breakfast will create a shift in your metabolism leading to less cravings for over eating at the end of the day. Try to focus on eating more balanced meals throughout the day, a balanced meal consist of a fist sized serving of Protein, Carbohydrates and Vegetables. I will list my daily diet below so you will have an idea of what a typical meal for me looks like. You should aim to eat at least 4-5 meals a day. Eating these smaller, more frequent meals will boost your metabolism and give you more energy throughout the day as well. This is just an overview for basic dieting, if you have more specific questions, feel free to send me an email by clicking the email button at the top right of the screen!

function p90(){

document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "My journey began with popping in the first disk to a fitness program that changed my life; P90X. I had a hard time going to a gym in the past because of the intimidating environment most gyms had. I was laughed at, questioned why I was there and that I was wasting my time. Needless to say, I didn't want to work out at that gym anymore! So I started P90X at home. Fast forward about 9 months, I completed 3 rounds of P90X and I got hooked on working out at home and enjoyed doing the program! I've continued to do home workouts for 6 year now with a few sessions at local gyms, but about 90% of my workouts at home. I currently follow the P90X2 program, which builds off of the original P90X just with more athletic training!";}
function wV(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Weighted Vest"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "AGAIN, PLEASE KNOW I'M NOT A TRAINER AND DO NOT RECOMMENDING THIS STYLE OF TRAINING FOR JUST ANYONE IN THIS SECTION!!! I say this, because after doing P90X for about 2 years, i decided i wanted to increase the intensity with weighted vest and wrist weights. The added weight from these items will add extra stress to the body and if you don't train with proper form you may end up hurting yourself. I worked my way up from an 8lb weight vest and gradually over time increased the weight as my body became accustomed to the weight. I currently train with 40lbs on my weighted vest and also wear two 2.5lb wrist weights. I want to say i don't believe this is a necessary training method to achieve your goals. I personally enjoy this style because I've done it for so long and enjoy the challenge!";}
function phil(){
document.getElementById("name").innerHTML="Philosophy"
document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "The whole point to any workout program should come down to this, why are you doing it? If you're training JUST to lose weight and to look good, while it's great to be in shape and we all want to look our best, this should be a very small reason to train. Instead, workout because you are becoming healthier. Don't workout to impress others, instead impress yourself. Push yourself to do the things you thought you'd never be able to do, try to see what you are truly capable of! Let's face it, working out isn't easy, it's tough and some days will be harder than others. If you are gonna do something this difficult for others instead of yourself, it'll become far more challenging. The best part is if you focus on making yourself better, for yourself, the other stuff (The Looks) will come naturally!";}

document.getElementById("txtwrp").innerHTML= "As i stated before, i'm not a personal trainer. I'm just a guy who figured it out through trial and error. I made mistakes and i learned from them. I'd love to help others skip the mistakes i made in my training and help anyone reach their goals! Along with a good exercise program, your diet is key to getting the best results possible. So check out the Diet Tab for more info on how proper diet will lead to awesome results!!! I will post in the Calendar tab what workouts i'll be doing so you may follow long.
